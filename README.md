Overview
--------
The rules defined herein presume a specific combination of tools and releases.
Java JDK 25, JavaFX 25.0.1, and Spring 4.0.  I had considered using GWT for a web
interface to replace the JavaFX clients, but decided I'd rather focus on JDK 25
compatability right now rather than purposely using a near-obsolete Java syntax.

As such, I'll be searching for a new web interface toolkit, ideally one that breaks
the single-form limitation of GWT and allows for multi-browser-tab/window functionality
without requiring excessive knowledge of JavaScript or JavaScript debugging to "make
it go."  Certainly React is popular at this time, but I know nothing about it at this
point.
